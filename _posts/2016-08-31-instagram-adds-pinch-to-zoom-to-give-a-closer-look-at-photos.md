  Instagram has launched a new feature that photographers will appreciate:
  starting today, you can pinch to zoom into photos and videos across the app.
  The pinch to zoom feature works on posts found in feeds, profiles, and on
  Explore. Releasing your fingers from your screen causes the photo or video to
  snap back to an unzoomed state.
